This is a docker container intended to act as a build and run enviroment for
FreeCAD within a Debian docker container, because I am too lazy to track down
the Solus OS `eopkg` packages for FreeCAD's buildtime dependancies.

The directories containing FreeCAD's sourcecode and the build, are not included
inside the docker image. Instead, they are attached to the docker container
when you run the container. This allows the built code to have continuity
across different docker containers, reducing the time for a build to occur.

# Build docker image

```
docker build -t freecad_env .
```

# Run docker image

```
xhost + # Keep in mind, this is very insecure, but lazy
fc_source=~/code/freecad_source
fc_build=~/code/freecad_build

docker run -it \
-v $fc_source:/mnt/source -v $fc_build:/mnt/build \
-e "DISPLAY" -e "QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
freecad_env
```

# Run build script

```
/home/build_script.sh
```

# Run FreeCAD
```
FreeCAD
```
